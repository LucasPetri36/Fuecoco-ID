The core idea of the project was to create a simple, yet cool, card that could display "details" about Fuecoco.
Fuecoco is a Fire-type Pokémon introduced in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, and its playful and fiery nature inspired the design elements of the card.
The card needed to be responsive, ensuring it looked great on various devices, from desktops to smartphones.
